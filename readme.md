# Perfect
This is perfect. It's pretty horrible. 

If you don't know, jsPerf took a dive into the bowels of spam hell, and uh, well, it's been down for a good while


## How do I even?

- `npm install` for grabbing the dependencies.
- `npm run build` to output your bundled scripts into the `dist` directory.
- `npm run develop` to watch your files, rebuild on save, and also run a server at `:8080`
- `npm run lint` to run a fine-toothed comb through it via Eslint.

## This garbage is still hot garbage

I'm workin' on it. :D. Basically all it does now is log which code is fastest in the console. It's a little sad, but hey, it's something!
ENJOY. OR DON'T. 
NO SKIN OFF MY BACK.
